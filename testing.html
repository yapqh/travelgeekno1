			<div class="link-header">1. Effiel Tower</div>
			<div class="link-content">
				<p>The Effiel tower stands 320 metres (1,050 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. During its construction,
				the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it 
				held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. However, because of the addition, in 1957, of the 
				antenna atop the Eiffel Tower, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building. Not including broadcast antennas, it is the second-tallest
				structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="link-header">2. Notre Dame de Paris</div>
			<div class="link-content">
				<p>Notre Dame de Paris, also known as Notre Dame Cathedral or simply Notre Dame, is a historic Roman Catholic Marian cathedral 
				on the eastern half of the Île de la Cité in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="link-header">3. Arc de Triomphe</div>
			<div class="link-content">
				<p>Construction on the Arc de Triomphe was begun in 1806 to commemorate Napoleon Bonaparte's victories throughout Europe, but as he began to lose
				battles the project was shelved and not completed until 1836 by King Louis-Philippe. The ostentatious monument is now at the center of the world's 
				largest traffic roundabout and marks the start of the Champs-Elysées. Today it is one of Paris' most famous tourist attractions and millions of 
				visitors climb the long stairway to the top every year.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="link-header">4. Palace of Versailles</div>
			<div class="link-content">
				<p>The Palace of Versailles, also known as The Château de Versailles, has been the scene for several historic events, not the least of which was 
				the signing, on 28 June 1919 within the Hall of Mirrors, of the Peace Treaty between defeated Germany and the Allies that brought the First
				World War officially to an end. The signing of the treaty at Versailles, of course, mirrored the proclamation, in 1871 within the same long hall,
				of the establishment of the German Empire under the Prussian king, subsequently the Kaiser.</p>
